# The Bob Assistant!
## Your own personal assistant!
## Inspiration
Cortana and Google Home
## How to use
See that little black text-prompt on the top-center of the screen? That is the command line, where you enter Bob's commands. [Bob isn't voice commanded or GUI]. The list of the commands is:
1. datetime| one of the first commands for Bob :)
2. clear| clear console
3. bing <query>| bing searchs <query> and opens the results in a new tab
4. addTodo <todoname>| adds todo to todo list
5. deleteTodo <todoname>| deletes todo from todo list, if <todoname> does not exist nothing is deleted
6. getTodos| gets todos - prints them in console
7. howTo <what>| similar to `bing <query>` except adds "How to " to the search query.
8. opn <place>| <place> must be either `gmail` or `scratch`, limited opens. 
9. bob-inf| gives info about bob
10. bob-update| refreshes page to "update" Bob (basically check `docs` folder for updates by refreshing Bob). Note: All interactions with Bob will be lost.
11. calc <expression>| calculates an arithmetic expression 
12. bob-msg _m:<msg>_r<recipients email or contact name>| drafts quick message in default mail app and prepares to send.
13. addContax name:<contaxname>_p:<people(s) email adresses seperated with semicolons>| adds contact with which recipients can be easily referred to in `bob-msg`
