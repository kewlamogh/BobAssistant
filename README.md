3. bing <query>| bing searchs <query> and opens the results in a new tab
4. addTodo <todoname>| adds todo to todo list
5. deleteTodo <todoname>| deletes todo from todo list, if <todoname> does not exist nothing is deleted
6. getTodos| gets todos - prints them in console
7. howTo <what>| similar to `bing <query>` except adds "How to " to the search query.
8. opn <place>| <place> must be either `gmail` or `scratch`, limited opens. 
9. bob-inf| gives info about bob
